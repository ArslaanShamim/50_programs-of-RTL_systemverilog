# SYSTEM VERILOG:
     SystemVerilog, standardized as IEEE 1800, is a hardware description and hardware verification language used for modeling, designing, simulating, testing, and
     implementing electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog with some extensions, and as of 2008 Verilog is part of the same IEEE standard. RISCV is an open
     source software Standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) originally developed to support research and education in computer architecture.
